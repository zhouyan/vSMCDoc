  Sequential Monte Carlo is a family of algorithms for sampling from a sequence
  of distributions. Some of these algorithms, such as particle filters, are
  widely used in the physics and signal processing researches. More recent
  developments have established their application in more general inference
  problems such as Bayesian modeling.

  These algorithms have attracted considerable attentions in recent years as
  they admit natural and scalable parallelization. However, these algorithms
  are perceived to be difficult to implement. In addition, parallel programming
  is often unfamiliar to many researchers though conceptually appealing,
  especially for sequential Monte Carlo related fields. A \cpp template library
  is presented for the purpose of implementing general sequential Monte Carlo
  algorithms on parallel hardware.
