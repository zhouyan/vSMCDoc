\chapter{Configuration macros}
\label{chap:Configuration macros}

The library has a few configuration macros. All these macros can be overwritten
by the user by defining them with proper values before including any of the
library's headers. Most of the macros have the prefix \cppinline{VSMC_HAS_},
which specify if a feature is available to the library. A few have the prefix
\cppinline{VSMC_USE_}, which specify if a feature shall be used in the case
that it is available. A handful remaining ones define some constants or types
used by the library. These macros are listed in table~\ref{tab:Configuration
  macros}.
